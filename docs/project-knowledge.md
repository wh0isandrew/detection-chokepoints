# Detection Chokepoints — Project Knowledge Base

## Architecture

Jekyll site deployed via GitHub Pages. Data-driven: chokepoint YAML files in
`chokepoints/<tactic>/<slug>.yml` are the source of truth. `scripts/aggregate.py`
builds `_data/chokepoints.yml` (Jekyll data layer), `assets/js/search-index.json`
(Fuse.js), and `_chokepoints/<slug>.md` (collection stubs). CI runs aggregate
before jekyll build.

## Key Files

- `_layouts/chokepoint.html` — renders all chokepoint detail pages (sidebar nav,
  stage-grouped detections, variant cards with lure/payload/command blocks)
- `_layouts/default.html` — base layout with nav, theme toggle, footer
- `index.html` — landing page with framework section, badge guide, search, cards
- `assets/css/style.css` — all styles (dark/light theme via CSS variables)
- `assets/js/search.js` — Fuse.js fuzzy search with tactic/priority filters
- `attack-chains/index.md` — attack chains landing with ecosystem flow diagram

- 8 variants (PHP Shell, PolyDrop, IronNetInjector, NodeLoader, Lu0Bot, AutoHotKey, etc.)
- 3 stages: Interpreter Deployment, Interpreter Execution, Malicious Script Action
- Stage 1 broadened to cover disk-based binaries and in-memory DLL loading
- Key detection: non-default interpreter running from user-writable path

### Remote Execution Tools (lateral-movement)
- 7 variants (Impacket, CrackMapExec, NetExec, Evil-WinRM, Metasploit, Sliver, Havoc)
- 3 stages: Network Authentication, Remote Process/Service Creation, Lateral Spread
- Key detection: network logon + service creation + services.exe spawning cmd.exe

### Renamed RMM Tools (initial-access)
- 9 variants (AnyDesk, TeamViewer, ScreenConnect, UltraViewer, RustDesk, SimpleHelp, etc.)
- 3 stages: Browser Download, User Execution, Outbound RMM Connection
- 9 MasqueradeThemes documented (tax, SSN, invoice, IT helpdesk, calendar, etc.)
- Key detection: PE OriginalFilename metadata mismatch with disk filename

## Sigma Rules (26 total)

All rules have: concise descriptions (1-3 sentences), valid UUIDs, no invalid
modifiers, filter_legit_software blocks. Organized as research/hunt/analyst per
chokepoint. ClickFix also has hunt-network.yml and etw-clipboard.yml.

## YAML Schema Per Chokepoint

Each chokepoint YAML has these key sections:
- Metadata: Name, Id, MitreIds, Tactics, DetectionPriority, ThreatPrevalence
- AttackerControls / AttackerCannotControl (framework analysis)
- Chokepoints: stages with Input, Invariant, Observable, WhyCantBypass, LogSources, DetectionTier, SigmaRef, TruePositive
- Variations: with Name, FirstSeen, Status, SourceURL, Notes, VariantId, Command/Lure/Payloads, ChokepointMapping
- Detections: Research/Hunt/Analyst with Description, LogSources, Logic, ExpectedFPRate, SigmaRule
- EarlyDetections, EvolutionTimeline, OsintSources, EmulationScript, RelatedChokepoints

## Template & Framework

- `templates/chokepoint-template.yml` — full template with Graeber framework attribution
- `FRAMEWORK.md` — 6-step methodology adapted from Matt Graeber's Red Canary research
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contributor guide with new required fields

## Site Design

- Dark theme default (CSS variables), light theme toggle
- Sticky sidebar nav on chokepoint pages with scroll spy (IntersectionObserver)
- Stage-grouped detection strategy (replaced old tab layout)
- Pill-shaped flow connectors between stages
- Controls vs constants table at top of each chokepoint page
- Variant cards: expandable with Lure/Payload (initial access) or Command/Artifact (post-compromise)
- Badge guide on landing page (Research, Hunt, Analyst, Pre-Exec, FP levels, New, Updated)
- Attack chains landing: convergence principle, ecosystem flow, reading guide

## OSINT Pivots (32 total)

Platforms: URLScan (7), VirusTotal Intelligence (6), Shodan (4), GitHub Code Search (4),
Censys (2), LOLDrivers (1), LOLRMM (1), ANY.RUN (1), Ransomware.live (1).
All URLScan queries use exact matches (no wildcards/parens) for anonymous access.

## Source URLs

74/75 variants have SourceURL fields. Only BlackSanta EDR Killer lacks a source
(insufficient public reporting). Sources verified via WebFetch where possible.
Sophos URLs updated from news.sophos.com to www.sophos.com (301 redirects).
