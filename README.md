# Detection Chokepoints

> **TTPs evolve. Chokepoints don't.**

## The Military Analogy

In 480 BC, 300 Spartans held the pass at Thermopylae against a Persian army of hundreds
of thousands. The narrow coastal pass — a chokepoint — stripped the Persians of their
numerical advantage. To advance, they *had* to traverse it. Every attacker, every time.

During the Cold War, NATO planners identified the Fulda Gap as the likely invasion route
for Warsaw Pact armor into Western Germany. The geography forced any large armored force
through a handful of passable corridors. Defend those corridors and you neutralize the
mass.

**Detection engineering has the same opportunity.** No matter how many ransomware
families, RMM tools, or clipboard-attack variants emerge, every attacker must traverse
certain chokepoints — conditions that *must* be met for the technique to work. Detect
the chokepoint, and you detect all current and future variations that require it.

---

## Why Chokepoints?

| Traditional Detection | Chokepoint Detection |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Detects a specific tool or hash | Detects the requirement the tool must satisfy |
| Breaks when the tool is renamed or replaced | Survives tool rotation, obfuscation, and variation |
| Narrow coverage (one threat family) | Broad coverage (all families sharing the chokepoint) |
| Requires constant signature updates | Durable — new tools hit the same chokepoints |
| High long-term maintenance cost | Low long-term maintenance cost |

**Time = Money.** Dwell time has compressed from weeks to hours as Initial Access
Brokers (IABs) sell pre-authenticated environments to ransomware operators. There's no
time to chase every new tool signature. Chokepoints let you strangle threats at the
conditions they *cannot avoid*.

## The Framework

Every chokepoint is defined by three questions:

```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│      Scope      │      Variations      │        Prerequisites         │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ Which tactic(s) │ What tools/methods   │ What MUST be true for this   │
│ and technique   │ exploit this         │ to succeed — regardless of   │
│ does this cover?│ chokepoint today?    │ tool choice?                 │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

The **prerequisites** are the chokepoint. Everything else is just the current
implementation.

---

## Detection Maturity Model

Chokepoint detections are built iteratively at three levels:

| Level | Goal | False Positive Rate | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Research** | Visibility, baseline understanding | High | Threat research, log source validation |
| **Hunt** | Refined coverage, noise reduction | Medium | Proactive hunting, campaign detection |
| **Analyst** | Production alerting, low FP | Low | SOC alerting, automated IR response |

Start broad. The research rule tells you what's in your environment. The hunt rule
tells you what's interesting. The analyst rule tells your SOC what to respond to.

## Why Now?

The RaaS ecosystem has changed the economics of detection:

```
Time to Ransom (TTR) Compression:
  2020: ~21 days average
  2022: ~7 days average
  2024: ~2 days average
  2025: <24 hours median     ← Mandiant M-Trends 2025
```

**Why so fast?** Initial Access Brokers (IABs). Infostealers harvest credentials and
session tokens at scale. IABs sell pre-mapped enterprise environments to ransomware
operators — complete with domain admin creds, VPN access, and network maps. Ransomware
groups skip the initial access and reconnaissance phases entirely.

Detection now requires fewer chances. Chokepoints are how you maximize each one.

## How to Contribute

This is a community resource for detection engineers, threat hunters, and incident
responders. Contributions should focus on **chokepoints** — the invariant requirements
attackers cannot bypass — not specific IOCs or tool signatures.

**Good contributions:**
- New chokepoint entries with all three detection maturity levels
- New variations on existing chokepoints (with evolution timeline entries)
- Improved sigma rules with lower false positive rates
- Free intel resources tied to specific chokepoints

**Not a fit:**
- Raw IOC dumps (IPs, domains, hashes) without detection logic
- Tool-specific signatures without chokepoint framing
- Vendor-specific content without broader applicability

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full process, schema requirements,
and PR checklist.
